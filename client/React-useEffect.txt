useEffect(asyncAction,[]);

GENERA EL SIGUIENTE WARNING:

    Warning: useEffect must not return anything besides a function, which is used for clean-up.

    It looks like you wrote useEffect(async () => ...) or returned a Promise.
    Instead, write the async function inside your effect and call it immediately:

        useEffect(() => {
          async function fetchData() {
            // You can await here
            const response = await MyAPI.getData(someId);
            // ...
          }
          fetchData();
        }, [someId]); // Or [] if effect doesn't need props or state
